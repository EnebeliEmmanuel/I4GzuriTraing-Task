I am a frontend/Blockchain-developer
I believe that beautiful and intuitive experiences are ways to transform how users connect with the physical world.
I'm a self-taught frontend developer currently mastering the skills one step at a time. My HTML, CSS and Javascript skills are something good to write home about. My fault is Responsive Design, I just love to see a page I create have awesome responsiveness on both larger and smaller screens. And right now, I'm working hard to level up my js skills.
